# PNG to WebP

A stupidly simple Node.js script to convert PNG images to WebP format.

## How to use?
1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies.
2. Create a directory named `Images` in the root directory. Store all images you want to convert in the same directory. You can use nested directories as well.
3. Execute the script with the following command: `npm run dev`.
4. Converted images will be stored in the `WebP` directory.
